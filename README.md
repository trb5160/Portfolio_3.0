Tom Barber - Portfolio

Description: As a prospective web-developer, a well-made portfolio is a must. To help with that, I was tasked with updating a portfolio I had made in the past. This is the second time that I've updated the website to bring it more in line with what I want.  The changes that I made to this one were smaller than before.  
I was happy with the general layout of the page, and as such I spent the bulk of the time fixing errors in the code that I did not catch last time.  I finally got
the website navbar working, I added a link to the github repositories that go with the pieces I included in the site, and I fixed the link to my resume at the end so that it would show up when someone other than me looked at it.  With these updates, I feel that the website functions a lot better than it does in its previous 
incarnations.  Any future improvements would be to add entirely new functionality instead of improving what's already here.
