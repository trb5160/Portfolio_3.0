Tom Barber - Portfolio

Description: As a prospective web-developer, a well-made portfolio is a must. To help with that, I was tasked with updating a portfolio I had made in the past. To accomplish this, I made use of bootstrap to make the webpage look cleaner. Improvements made were a cleaner looking navbar, a curved profile picture, and bootstrap figures to show off previous work. Future improvements I would like to make include showing more of my previous work, as well as possibly using javascript to seperate the different sections so that the sections of the portfolio are seperate pages instead of all being on the same one.
